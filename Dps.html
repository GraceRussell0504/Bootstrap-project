            <h1>What is the job of DPS?</h1>
            <p>DPS play one main role: deal damage. Depending on which DPS is playing, their job is either to break the enemy tanks shield, or target the enemy's supports so their team can't be healed. A DPS' job is also to help protect their support against poking characters.</p>

                <ol>Tracer is a close-range character he does very little damage, but she can pick off enemy supports who are unaware of their surroundings easily.</ol>
                
                
                <li>Soldier</li>
                <ol>Soldier has a regular rifle that does high-damage but it has a good amount of recoil. He also has rockets that he can launch every few seconds that are hard to hit, but do a lot of damage.</ol>
