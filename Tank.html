            <h1>What is the role of a tank?</h1>
            <p>A tanks job is to protect the front-line and push the team forward. Tanks can either target the backline of the enemy team or stay back and protect their own team. Tanks have a very large health pool and deal high damage, but are reliant on their supports to keep them alive.</p>
